## 🧠 Sudoku Trainer — Offline Desktop App

Sudoku Trainer is a Python-based, fully offline Sudoku practice application designed to help users (like my little brother!) sharpen their logical thinking skills. Built with Tkinter, it includes timer-based gameplay, real-time scoring, and a “Hint System” to guide the player step-by-step — all packaged into a safe .exe executable.

    ⚡ Designed to run offline, distraction-free, and safely — no file access, no internet dependency.

## 🚀 Features

🎮 **Multiple Puzzles**: Preloaded set of puzzles with varying difficulty.

⏱️ **Timer**: Tracks the time spent solving each puzzle.

🧮 **Score Tracker**: Awards points for correct entries; deducts for hints.

💡 **Smart Hint System**: Recommends the next optimal move using backtracking logic.

🔒 **Safe Offline .exe**: Runs on any Windows system without installation, no external file access.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.13

Tkinter for GUI

json for puzzle storage

PyInstaller for .exe packaging

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the senior from IIT Delhi for feedback and suggestions.

Built for my younger brother — to learn, solve, and become a logic master.

## 🧠 Vision

This project started small — a simple app for someone I care about. But it’s now a stepping stone on my path to mastering AI/ML, systems programming, and building real-world software that’s actually useful.

**Expect more upgrades soon**.
